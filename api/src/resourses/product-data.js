        "name": "Taylor 255ce 12-Strings" ,
        "description": "For those guitarists looking to broaden their musical palette, this 254ce makes a strong case as the ideal 12-string for players in all situations. Layered rosewood back and sides combine with a solid Sitka spruce top to produce a vivid, octave-rich tone layered with overtonal complexity. Shimmering, cascading highs blend smoothly with a rich low end, offering a versatile tone that performs beautifully in solo settings or as an accompanying instrument played alongside a larger ensemble. The spruce top delivers top-end clarity that helps the 254ce cut through any mix, while layered back and sides make this an ideal option for travel and practice sessions. Appointed with crisp white binding, a three-ring rosette, 4mm Dot inlays, and a Venetian cutaway, this guitar ships with ES2 electronics in a hardshell gig bag." ,
